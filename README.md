# Ever wondered how many cities have the same names?
Often times during long road trips you may find yourself passing a city with a familiar name.
I used to wonder how many cities shared names.
In order to find out how many shared names and how they connected to each other, I wrote this program.

## How to run
If you don't want to generate an up to date city list, skip to step 4.
1. Clone this repo
2. Download and unzip cities500.txt from http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cities500.zip
3. Once cities500.txt is in the same directory as readCities.js, you can run `node readCities.js`
  - This will update cities.js
4. Open index.html in your favorite webgl compatible browser

Feel free to change the code locally and discover your own interesting connections between cities!
